# Inventa (latin for Discovery)

Inventa is a visualiser/path computer for network topology data. Currently it's fed by BGP-LS using the GoBGP libraries but there are plans for more inputs in future.

It has the ability to show the entire topology, and also calculate/display visually shortest/best path(s) between source and destination nodes.

##Â To use
Copy config.yaml.example to config.yaml somewhere and edit
```
cd src/inventa/
go run . -c /path/to/config.yaml
```

## Docker
You can build/run a docker container for this, put config.yaml in an empty
directory and mount it into the container.

```
docker build -t inventa .
docker run --rm -v/path/to/local/conf/directory:/etc/inventa:ro --expose 8123 inventa
```

More/better instructions to come!
